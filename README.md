Prashant Sharma — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase who I am, what I build, and the skills I’m developing as a frontend developer. I designed and built everything from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no heavy tools — just clean, simple web technologies.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and is fully responsive, so it works smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.
